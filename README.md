# Xs-and-Os
A simple game in which two players alternatively puts Xs and Os in one of a compartment of a 9 square grid. 
The player who first gets 3 of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.
Initially, the program ask Player 1 Name & Player 2 Name : which marks the user prefers ("X" or "O") respectively. The player that gets to play with the "X" marks will 
play first (we call him/her by player 1 name) and the player that gets to play with the "O" marks will play second (we call him/her player 2 name).
